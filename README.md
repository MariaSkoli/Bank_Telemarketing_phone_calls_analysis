# Bank_Telemarketing_phone_calls_analysis


The aim of the **first part** of the analysis is to determine which among the available features influence the possibility that the phone call will be successful, namely that the client will subscribe to a long-term deposit. 

### Logistic Regression

* In the report, certain particularities of the features will first be explored in an exploratory analysis based on visual elements. 
* Then, models are constructed in an attempt to identify the key variables that contribute to or affect the outcome of the phone contact. 
* Once the optimal model is determined, we will check how well this model can interpret our data.

The aim of the **second part** is to use both supervised and unsupervised methods aiming in prediction. 

### Classification

* We are going to use supervised learning methods to identify to which category (Subscribed or non-subscribed) a new observation belongs. 
* We will examine 3 different methods of Classification. Some of them are classified as hard classification methods meaning that we assign each observation to a class, no uncertainty around, and other are classified as soft classification because we have also available the probabilities of belonging to each class. 
* Namely, we will use logistic regression and na√Øve bayes as soft classification methods and the decision trees method as hard.
* Finally, we will compare them based on the accuracy and the predictive ability.

### Clustering 

We are going to find groups of observations with the property that within the group the observations look similar but within different groups are totally different.

* We will examine if there are similarities across individuals, using the mathematical concept of distance. 
* After the selection of the optimal number of clusters we will try to interpret the result.
* We are going to use both supervised and unsupervised methods aiming in prediction.
